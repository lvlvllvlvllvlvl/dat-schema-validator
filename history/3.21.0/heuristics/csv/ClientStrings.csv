It doesn't matter which item the gem is socketed into, but the socket has to match the colour of the gem. In other words, red skill gems can go in red sockets, and can't go in blue or green sockets.\r\n\r\nSupport gems work very similarly to skill gems, except they don't grant you a skill by themselves. Instead, support gems can augment the skill gems they are linked to. Not all skill and support gems work together; You can't use a 'Melee Physical Damage Support' with a spell, for example.","","",-1777809235,""

3061,"TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeContent1","Your character build is primarily composed of the items the character is wearing, the skill and support gems that are socketed within those items, and the passive skills you have chosen from the passive skill tree. Because the passive skill tree lays the groundwork for your items and gems, the passive skill tree is arguably the core of every character build. \r\n\r\nWhenever you level up, and upon completing certain quests, you'll get a passive skill point. Each point can be allocated on the passive skill tree to gain the benefits of the passive skill (often referred to as a 'passive') it is spent on.\r\n\r\nYou can only allocate points on passives that are connected to your other allocated passives. There are far, far more passive skills on the tree than you can ever allocate, so you need to think carefully about what you want to choose. It is often worth planning ahead.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of passive skill:","","",1950660283,""

Mastery passives provide a selection of one of many special stats related to the Mastery theme (e.g. Fire or Bow). Like regular passives, Masteries require a passive point to allocate. Mastery passives are shared across the tree, so Fire Masteries everywhere give the same selection of special stats. Special stats cannot be allocated more than once.","","",1515546507,""

3087,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent1","Your Path of Exile character is primarily built from a combination of passive skills, skill gems, and items. Both the passive tree and the items can seem overwhelming at first, so in this tutorial we will cover some of the basics.","","",448757107,""
3088,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent2","The most important thing to know is how the passive tree interacts with your character. In general, passive skills affect all the relevant stats on your character, regardless of where they come from. We call these global modifiers.","","",-299456757,""
3089,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent3","In the example above, we see that the 'increased maximum life' passives add together before they affect the character's life. Most passive skills, especially any that use the word 'increased', act this way.","","",1686474091,""
3090,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent4","Passives that specifically say they grant 'more' or 'less' of something are the exceptions to the above rule. These are applied after all of the increases, acting like multipliers. Unlike passives which increase something, passives which provide 'more' or 'less' of something never add together and instead each apply their multiplicative effect separately. These terms appear on Keystones in the passive skill tree, but are most commonly seen on support gems.","","",-808639466,""
3091,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent5","Item mods tend to come in two varieties: 'global mods', which act like the passive skills, and 'local mods', which affect the item itself. Compare the weapons below, and note that the magic weapon (on the right) has 'Increased Physical Damage'. You'll see that the weapon's Physical Damage is higher, and is a different colour. It is this number that is used when other modifiers, such as your passive skills, are used to calculate how much damage your attacks deal.","","",-368105741,""
3092,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent6","The same is true for increases to armour on items that naturally provide armour, or increases to evasion on items that naturally provide evasion, and so on.  \r\n\t\t\t\r\nSome mods, such as 'Increased Attack Speed', can appear on both weapons and armour. Like the Increased Physical Damage modifier, the Increased Attack Speed on the weapon shown below is local to the weapon, and changes that specific weapon's rate of attack. The gloves shown below also have Increased Attack Speed, but they affect any weapon you are holding and use the Attacks Per Second value displayed on the weapon to calculate how quickly you attack.","","",-803274219,""
3093,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent7","The attack speed mod on these gloves is a global modifier, so it adds together with other global increases to attack speed, including those on your passive tree.\r\n \r\nAs a general rule (though there are occasional exceptions), if the values in the top section of an item are different to the normal basetype, they are benefitting from local modifiers. If a modifier on an item doesn't seem to be affecting anything in the top section, then it is global.\r\n\r\nSee if you can work out which mods are local and which mods are global in the image below.","","",1429781206,""

Alva is trying to find the location of the lost treasure temple of Atzoatl using ancient Waystones that begin appearing from the Causeway onwards. With her help, you will travel back in time two thousand years, to the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. During this time, you can help influence the temple's construction, so that when you eventually find it, it is filled with glorious treasure.\r\n\r\nYou'll only have a limited amount of time during this visit to influence the layout of Atzoatl in the present day, but this time can be extended by slaying its inhabitants. Enemies will not drop loot during your Incursions, but once the timer runs out, you'll be returned to the present-day and showered with loot based on how well you did.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary objectives to pursue during your incursion: Architects and Altars of Passage.","","",-1681688037,""
3985,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent2","Each chamber in Atzoatl has several walls which could potentially allow it to connect to another chamber. Some of these may already be connected, but many won't. If, during your Incursion, an enemy drops a Stone of Passage, you can pick it up and place it in an Altar of Passage, and it will connect the chamber you are in to an adjacent one.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because when you visit the Temple of Atzoatl during the present day, you may only be able to reach the chambers you managed to connect in the past!","","",-959985368,""
3986,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent3","Within each Incursion you can find two Vaal Architects. By slaying one, you will allow the other to escape and later develop that chamber in their own vision. If the surviving Architect had previously influenced the development of that room, that room will then be upgraded. If not, then that room will change to something within their realm of expertise.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you land in the Banquet Hall during an incursion and slay the Architect of Fortifications, allowing the Architect of Toxins to survive, the Banquet Hall will become the Poison Garden. If in a later Incursion you land in the Poison Garden and kill the Architect of Iron, again allowing the Architect of Toxins survive, it will be upgraded to the Cultivar Chamber.","","",-1532867573,""

Some are purely positive, while others may put you at significant risk for valuable rewards. By upgrading the Cultivar Chamber to the Toxic Grove, for example, you will fill the Temple of Atzoatl with dangerously poisonous plants, but you will also give yourself the opportunity to loot a unique item that can be found nowhere else.","","",-1445708854,""

Use Crawler to select which adjacent area within the mine you would like to explore, and it will start moving in that direction. Be aware that this consumes some amount of Voltaxic Sulphite. \r\n\r\nAlong the way to your destination you will encounter monsters and other paths into the dark depths of the mine, and at your destination you may find a difficult fight!
