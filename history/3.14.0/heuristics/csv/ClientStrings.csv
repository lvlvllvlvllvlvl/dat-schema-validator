Skill gems must be socketed into your equipped weapons and armour in order for you to be able to use the skill they grant. It doesn't matter which item the gem is socketed into, but the socket has to match the colour of the gem. In other words, red skill gems can go in red sockets, and can't go in blue or green sockets.\r\n\r\nSupport gems work very similarly to skill gems, except they don't grant you a skill by themselves. Instead, support gems can augment the skill gems they are linked to.

Each point can be allocated on the passive skill tree to gain the benefits of the passive skill (often referred to as a 'passive') it is spent on.\r\n\r\nYou can only allocate points on passives that are connected to your other allocated passives.

3206,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent2","The most important thing to know is how the passive tree interacts with your character.

3207,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent3","In the example above, we see that the 'increased maximum life' passives add together before they affect the character's life. Most passive skills, especially any that use the word 'increased', act this way.","",1686474091,""
3208,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent4","Passives that specifically say they grant 'more' or 'less' of something are the exceptions to the above rule. These are applied after all of the increases, acting like multipliers.

3209,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent5","Item mods tend to come in two varieties: 'global mods', which act like the passive skills, and 'local mods', which affect the item itself. Compare the weapons below, and note that the magic weapon (on the right) has 'Increased Physical Damage'. You'll see that the weapon's Physical Damage is higher, and is a different colour. It is this number that is used when other modifiers, such as your passive skills, are used to calculate how much damage your attacks deal.","",-368105741,""
3210,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent6","The same is true for increases to armour on items that naturally provide armour, or increases to evasion on items that naturally provide evasion, and so on.  \r\n\t\t\t\r\nSome mods, such as 'Increased Attack Speed', can appear on both weapons and armour. Like the Increased Physical Damage modifier, the Increased Attack Speed on the weapon shown below is local to the weapon, and changes that specific weapon's rate of attack. The gloves shown below also have Increased Attack Speed, but they affect any weapon you are holding and use the Attacks Per Second value displayed on the weapon to calculate how quickly you attack.","",-803274219,""
3211,"TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent7","The attack speed mod on these gloves is a global modifier, so it adds together with other global increases to attack speed, including those on your passive tree.\r\n \r\nAs a general rule (though there are occasional exceptions), if the values in the top section of an item are different to the normal basetype, they are benefitting from local modifiers. If a modifier on an item doesn't seem to be affecting anything in the top section, then it is global.\r\n\r\nSee if you can work out which mods are local and which mods are global in the image below.","",1429781206,""

Typically an item may only have one crafted mod at a time, but any existing crafted mod can be replaced via the Crafting Bench for a small additional cost.\r\n\r\nYou can also invite the masters to your Hideout. There are currently 5 masters -- Einhar, Niko, Alva, Jun and Zana -- although you can invite Helena and Navali to your Hideout as well. Each master has a gameplay mechanic associated with them, such as capturing beasts for Einhar.","",-46325735,""
3671,"TutorialPanelHideoutContent2","Besides the functional objects within your Hideout, you can place hundreds of special Hideout decorations. Some of these come with your Hideout, but many more can be purchased with Favour, a resource earned by helping masters like Einhar and Niko. Each master has their own Hideout decorations they can sell, though what is available is limited by the master's decoration level. Each master has a different requirement for raising their decoration level. You can see the requirement by hovering over their level when talking to them. \r\n\r\nYour Hideout, the masters within it, and all your decorations, both placed and stored, are all shared across all leagues. That means your Hideout will be the same on Standard as it is in a challenge league. The recipes available on your Hideouts crafting bench are not, and must be rediscovered in temporary leagues.","",833516964,""
3672,"TutorialPanelHideoutContent3","Not happy with the look of your Hideout? Many new Hideouts can be found through exploration and gameplay, including some very rare ones found exclusively in the Atlas of Worlds, so keep your eyes peeled. Others can be purchased directly from the Microtransactions store.\r\n\r\nYou can swap your Hideout to any you've unlocked by talking to Helena. Any decorations you've placed in your old Hideout will remain there until reclaimed, so you can swap between Hideouts safely without fear of your time spent decorating going to waste!","",2055254882,""

Flasks can come in normal, magic or unique rarity, but not rare. \r\n\r\nUsually, flasks refill as you slay monsters. This means as long as you're successfully engaging in combat, you should always have a flask or two available for use. But if you get into a spot of trouble and empty your flasks, you'll either have to carefully slay enough monsters to refill them or return to Town. \r\n\r\nYour flasks also refill when you return to Town, so jumping into a portal is a valid strategy when you're running low on flask charges.

4102,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent1","Once you have reached Act 7, you may encounter Alva Valai. Alva is trying to find the location of the lost treasure temple of Atzoatl using ancient Waystones that begin appearing from the Causeway onwards. With her help, you will travel back in time two thousand years, to the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. During this time, you can help influence the temple's construction, so that when you eventually find it, it is filled with glorious treasure.\r\n\r\nYou'll only have a limited amount of time during this visit to influence the layout of Atzoatl in the present day, but this time can be extended by slaying its inhabitants. Enemies will not drop loot during your Incursions, but once the timer runs out, you'll be returned to the present-day and showered with loot based on how well you did.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary objectives to pursue during your incursion: Architects and Altars of Passage.","",-1681688037,""
4103,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent2","Each chamber in Atzoatl has several walls which could potentially allow it to connect to another chamber. Some of these may already be connected, but many won't. If, during your Incursion, an enemy drops a Stone of Passage, you can pick it up and place it in an Altar of Passage, and it will connect the chamber you are in to an adjacent one.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because when you visit the Temple of Atzoatl during the present day, you may only be able to reach the chambers you managed to connect in the past!","",-959985368,""
4104,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent3","Within each Incursion you can find two Vaal Architects. By slaying one, you will allow the other to escape and later develop that chamber in their own vision. If the surviving Architect had previously influenced the development of that room, that room will then be upgraded. If not, then that room will change to something within their realm of expertise.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you land in the Banquet Hall during an incursion and slay the Architect of Fortifications, allowing the Architect of Toxins to survive, the Banquet Hall will become the Poison Garden. If in a later Incursion you land in the Poison Garden and kill the Architect of Iron, again allowing the Architect of Toxins survive, it will be upgraded to the Cultivar Chamber.","",-1532867573,""
4105,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent4","The types and tiers of the rooms you help engineer through your Incursions ultimately form the Temple of Atzoatl in the present day. \r\n\r\nEach room has a different effect. Some are purely positive, while others may put you at significant risk for valuable rewards. By upgrading the Cultivar Chamber to the Toxic Grove, for example, you will fill the Temple of Atzoatl with dangerously poisonous plants, but you will also give yourself the opportunity to loot a unique item that can be found nowhere else.","",-1445708854,""
4106,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent5","Once you've performed enough Incursions, Alva will discover the location of Atzoatl, and will offer you the opportunity to go there. At long last, you can explore the temple you helped create, and loot it for all it's worth! \r\n\r\nAfter you've visited the temple in the present-day, the next time you find Alva in the world, she will offer you the opportunity to start your Incursions all over again, with a new temple layout and with new opportunities to maximise your rewards.","",-1165974854,""
4107,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent6","The Incursion league includes a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Incursion Bandana. At 24, you will receive the Incursion Cloak. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Incursion Portal Effect. These cosmetic effects are only obtainable in this league. \r\n\r\nFrom the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Incursion Totem Pole decoration to display in your Hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Incursion challenges you completed during the league.","",-913153558,""

4787,"TutorialPanelAtlasObjectivesContent2","This special property is unique to your Atlas -- a party member can't benefit from the objectives on your Atlas.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are consumed as soon as you open the associated map. New objectives are guaranteed to appear once a day, but you also have a chance to generate a new objective whenever you complete a map.\r\n\r\nNew objectives select maps based on the tier of your last completed map, within two tiers. In other words, if you complete a tier 10 map, a new objective may appear on a tier 9, 10 or 11 map.
