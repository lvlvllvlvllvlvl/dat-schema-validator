Such is the impression one tends to garner from the accounts written of events following Zerphi's death.\r\n\r\nAtziri's orders are quoted in a number of different texts. Doryani was \""to make any effort within the realms of possibility, and to act without fear of question or consequence\"". And to what was Doryani expected to apply this supreme effort? The investigation of Zerphi's longevity and youthful vitality.\r\n\r\nThere is a particularly chilling manifest, containing endless lists of names, page upon page. The names of young men and women, ranging in age from sixteen to twenty-six, sent to Doryani for \""processing\"". Only those of \""full and recent maturity\"" were deemed capable of accommodating the \""necessary procedures\"" required without succumbing to \""premature expiration\"".\r\n\r\nYes, Queen Atziri was prepared to slaughter her own people in the desperate pursuit of perpetual youth and beauty.

Our literature was conceived and born within the Azmeri's cultural marriage with the Vaal.\r\n\r\nPrior to Vaal contact some 2500 years ago, the Azmerian culture had a purely oral tradition of story and record keeping. Afterwards, their literary culture blossomed, along with just about every other aspect of their fledgling civilisation. From the moment the first Vaalish embassadors set foot upon the rugged slopes of the Azmerian Ranges, the Vaal civilisation held the hand of the Azmeri as they grew from a primitive tribal existence into a cohesive culture of settlement and agriculture.\r\n\r\nYet while the Vaal were generous with their knowledge and guidance in many areas, there is one subject upon which they were notably silent: the Tears of Maji, now known as Virtue Gems. Despite an exhaustive search, neither account nor passing reference can be found regarding gem usage amongst the early Azmeri. Though they described the Vaal as having flesh adorned with glittering crystals, our Azmerian ancestors were never privy to the gems' potentials or powers. \r\n\r\nAt least, not until the first Vaal refugees came knocking five hundred years later.\r\n\r\n<i>{ -Trinian - Intellectus Prime}","","","","","",0,0,1,[72],""

They were welcomed, and cared for, but none could give the Azmeri the one thing they sought in return. None could tell them how the Vaal realm came to such a sudden and catastrophic end. An apocalypse that came to be known as The Fall.\r\n\r\nThe number 3126 is forever burned into Azmerian history.

From there, Veruso formed the first Legions and proceeded to conquer the lands beneath the Mantle, clearing it of the mindless constructs and fierce abominations left in the wake of The Fall.\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, Veruso ensured that his people lived \""with eyes open\"". The ancient Vaalish centres of learning and power were sealed and quarantined. Thaumaturgy was outlawed and those who stained themselves with Vaalish folly were burned for their sin.

Though it seems fanciful to contemplate a portion of our Empire cast in perpetual night, Azmerian writers of the time are unified in their depiction. Perhaps it was caused by peculiar weather patterns or some thaumaturgical residue of The Fall. On this matter, this humble historian is left in the uncomfortable state of pure conjecture. \r\n\r\nOn the first Sacrato of Lurici, 35 I.C., Alano himself wrote that \""our legions drove the dark being deep into the recesses of its lair and sealed it away for eternity\"".

Some time ago, I was commissioned in the repairing of a strange device delivered into my hands. A golden machine found broken in the ruins of Wraeclast.

He led us through numerous situations we thought fatal with an unflagging warm grin that let us know he believed in us.\r\n\r\nBut at some point, almost imperceptibly, Drox stopped making decisions for the group, and started focusing only on his new dream. His smiles turned to scowls. He remained fixated on this mad idea of building a kingdom in the Atlas. He became cold to Veritania and distant to the rest of us.

5632,"BaranGlyph3","","To the discoverer of this letter,\r\n\r\nWhat transpired here in this strange and twisted realm is beyond comprehension. An evil older than time itself roamed these lands feeding on the memories of Valdo Caeserius, a son of Oriath. \r\n\r\nAlas, the fiend that fed upon him was powerful beyond measure, and unerring in its desire to spread what we discovered was known as the 'Decay.' I know not how long we pursued the demon. Long enough that my allies began to show signs of madness. We'd surely have fallen to the evil were it not for Sirus' courageous leadership... and his sacrifice. \r\n\r\nWe could find no way to slay the demon, though we tried countless times. It was the daughter of Valdo who found a way to seal it, though it cost poor Zana her father, rest his soul. Our gambit would have failed were it not for Sirus. The demon would not give in, clawing its way from Zana's device. Sirus... He leapt onto it. We saw the demon tap into his body, at last relinquishing its grip. Sirus and the demon spiraled into the trap and out of our reality. Both gone. \r\n\r\nThen Sirus was there once more. None of us witnessed his return. His eyes did not move, he did not blink, and his mutterings... Mad and unceasing. Then his face contorted in ways I'd seen only from men possessed by the black spirit. He struck at us again and again. We could not restrain him. We had to flee that place. That is when we discovered our path home was sealed. Valdo's daughter had sabotaged our return. \r\n\r\nI do not know how long we have been trapped here. Weeks, at least. Possibly years. Time in the Atlas is a mirage. \r\n\r\nPlease, dear reader, if you have an ounce of sense in your body, do not dwell here. Return to Oriath, or wherever it is you are from. Tell of Sirus' heroism and sacrifice, and leave him, and us, to die with the secrets we uncovered.\r\n\r\nBaran, the Faithless","Audio/Dialogue/NPC/BaranTheCrusader/BA_50.ogg","","","","",0,0,1,[428],""

I could not hear God's whispers with such constant noise.\r\n\r\nI dare not visit him now. I want only to escape this prison and punish that insolent blasphemer, Caeserius, for her foolishness. Then, perhaps, I will return here with an army, and take the Atlas. What better show of faith is there than the establishment of a nation in God's name? And then?

She earned many tattoos of shame for her violations, and each time she was punished, she only grew more rebellious.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, she fled from the Plains of Vastiri entirely, and scores of delinquents went with her. They have since terrorised many with their banditry, but duty required I track her down when she stole Solerai's Spear from a Sarn merchant of ill repute. I live among these thieves and scoundrels because this is her world, and in this place I hear more about her activities in a single moon than I would in a year spent looking for her on my own.\r\n\r\nWe must retrieve the Spear.

Leaving a little trail as I go so I can find my way out. Little azurite fuse trail winding its way back to the storehouse. Cost me an arm and a leg, that powder. Anyway, I'm right under where I thought the High Templar's office was. Start piling the powder up right under his fat arse. Planning to blow him back to Innocence. \r\n\r\nWell, I start hearing a hissing noise. And I start seeing the blue light down the end of the tunnel turning an angry red. It's moving towards me quick. And I'm thinking, this is it. This is where it ends for me, but at least I'll blow that high pain in the arse skyward. Then it stops. No hissing. No light. Just a silhouette. Tall as a man ever was. Taller than Tibbs. Don't know how he even got through the storehouse hole. This man... this glorious man! \r\n\r\nPut it down! He shouts. It's not worth the trouble. Come. It's time to go!

His hand is extended to meet me. I reach out mine. There's an electricity between us. And as my fingers lock into his, he slaps a manacle around my wrist.

Right before I got discharged, Enoch was called up to a special unit we'd heard rumours about. A group under the direction of Piety, of all people. Supposedly some elite strike force, but no one personally knew anyone who was a part of it. 'Til Enoch, that is. \r\n\r\nAfter I started working for the Boss, I asked Whakano to find Enoch.

9199,"ZanaToTheEyeOfTheStorm","","Exile, this is urgent. While you were gone, our Map Device began acting strangely. Vibrating, humming, aligning its gears as though being tugged by invisible strings. I fear I know the cause...\r\n\r\nThere's an enormous storm at the heart of the Atlas that has masked all information in that region since Sirus' return. Sirus wants to escape, and he may have found a way. A Map Device of his own creation, built inside the Atlas, for a journey back to Wraeclast. That's the only possible explanation for our own Map Device's erratic movements. Even that storm wouldn't be able to diffuse the energies of another Device.\r\n\r\nWe must hurry, Exile.
