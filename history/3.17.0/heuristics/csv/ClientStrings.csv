Because the passive skill tree lays the groundwork for your items and gems, the passive skill tree is arguably the core of every character build. \r\n\r\nWhenever you level up, and upon completing certain quests, you'll get a passive skill point. Each point can be allocated on the passive skill tree to gain the benefits of the passive skill (often referred to as a 'passive') it is spent on.\r\n\r\nYou can only allocate points on passives that are connected to your other allocated passives. There are far, far more passive skills on the tree than you can ever allocate, so you need to think carefully about what you want to choose.

At the top of the Sarn Encampment is an entrance to Sarn Arena, an area for open, unstructured player-slaying.\r\n\r\nWant something more structured? You can duel individual players, or form a team and fight as a group. Path of Exile also supports a Capture the Flag game mode.\r\n\r\nThere are two main PvP brackets -- Open PvP, which has no limits on player level, and Low Level Dueling (LLD) which is limited to players of level 28 or below.\r\n\r\nLeo Redmane in the Sarn Encampment offers daily PvP missions, and rewards active PvPers with Hideout decorations and crafting options, similar to other Forsaken Masters.\r\n\r\nDying in a PvP area on a Hardcore league does not send you to Standard, but if you die to another player outside of a PvP area, such as during the Act 2 Bandit questline, you will be sent to Standard as normal.\r\n\r\nNote that special damage scaling rules are in place for PvP to level the playing field to some degree. Even so, the difference in both player skill and gear can be extreme, so don't become discouraged if you get slaughtered on your first try.","","",-1440510879,""

Your Hideout is your own private space, and is shared by all of the characters on your account, regardless of league (though access to certain things within your Hideout is still restricted by league). It comes with a stash, a guild stash if you're in a guild, a waypoint, and a crafting bench. \r\n\r\nThe crafting bench comes with several basic recipes by default, but many more can be unlocked as you journey through the campaign and participate in side content such as the Azurite Mine and the Eternal Labyrinth. Typically an item may only have one crafted mod at a time, but any existing crafted mod can be replaced via the Crafting Bench for a small additional cost.\r\n\r\nYou can also invite the masters to your Hideout. There are currently 5 masters -- Einhar, Niko, Alva, Jun and Zana -- although you can invite Helena and Navali to your Hideout as well.

Each master has a different requirement for raising their decoration level. You can see the requirement by hovering over their level when talking to them. \r\n\r\nYour Hideout, the masters within it, and all your decorations, both placed and stored, are all shared across all leagues.

Flasks can come in normal, magic or unique rarity, but not rare. \r\n\r\nUsually, flasks refill as you slay monsters. This means as long as you're successfully engaging in combat, you should always have a flask or two available for use. But if you get into a spot of trouble and empty your flasks, you'll either have to carefully slay enough monsters to refill them or return to Town. \r\n\r\nYour flasks also refill when you return to Town, so jumping into a portal is a valid strategy when you're running low on flask charges.

Alva is trying to find the location of the lost treasure temple of Atzoatl using ancient Waystones that begin appearing from the Causeway onwards. With her help, you will travel back in time two thousand years, to the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. During this time, you can help influence the temple's construction, so that when you eventually find it, it is filled with glorious treasure.\r\n\r\nYou'll only have a limited amount of time during this visit to influence the layout of Atzoatl in the present day, but this time can be extended by slaying its inhabitants. Enemies will not drop loot during your Incursions, but once the timer runs out, you'll be returned to the present-day and showered with loot based on how well you did.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary objectives to pursue during your incursion: Architects and Altars of Passage.","","",-1681688037,""
4154,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent2","Each chamber in Atzoatl has several walls which could potentially allow it to connect to another chamber. Some of these may already be connected, but many won't. If, during your Incursion, an enemy drops a Stone of Passage, you can pick it up and place it in an Altar of Passage, and it will connect the chamber you are in to an adjacent one.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because when you visit the Temple of Atzoatl during the present day, you may only be able to reach the chambers you managed to connect in the past!","","",-959985368,""
4155,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent3","Within each Incursion you can find two Vaal Architects. By slaying one, you will allow the other to escape and later develop that chamber in their own vision. If the surviving Architect had previously influenced the development of that room, that room will then be upgraded. If not, then that room will change to something within their realm of expertise.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you land in the Banquet Hall during an incursion and slay the Architect of Fortifications, allowing the Architect of Toxins to survive, the Banquet Hall will become the Poison Garden. If in a later Incursion you land in the Poison Garden and kill the Architect of Iron, again allowing the Architect of Toxins survive, it will be upgraded to the Cultivar Chamber.","","",-1532867573,""
4156,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent4","The types and tiers of the rooms you help engineer through your Incursions ultimately form the Temple of Atzoatl in the present day. \r\n\r\nEach room has a different effect. Some are purely positive, while others may put you at significant risk for valuable rewards. By upgrading the Cultivar Chamber to the Toxic Grove, for example, you will fill the Temple of Atzoatl with dangerously poisonous plants, but you will also give yourself the opportunity to loot a unique item that can be found nowhere else.","","",-1445708854,""
4157,"TutorialPanelIncursionContent5","Once you've performed enough Incursions, Alva will discover the location of Atzoatl, and will offer you the opportunity to go there.

Use Crawler to select which adjacent area within the mine you would like to explore, and it will start moving in that direction. Be aware that this consumes some amount of Voltaxic Sulphite. \r\n\r\nAlong the way to your destination you will encounter monsters and other paths into the dark depths of the mine, and at your destination you may find a difficult fight!
