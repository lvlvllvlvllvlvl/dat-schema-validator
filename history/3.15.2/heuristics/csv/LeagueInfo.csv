In almost every update, we provide new ways to improve your characters, more effective skills to use, and ways to craft better and more powerful items. The power level of end-game Path of Exile characters has increased tenfold since Launch. From this expansion onwards, we are working to restore some of the challenge that Path of Exile is known for.\n\nIn addition to a substantial Flask Rework, we're reducing the power level of pure-damage support gems, making triggered skills cost mana, tweaking the most powerful movement skills and making the enemies in Path of Exile's first act much more dangerous. Our work to improve the level of challenge in Path of Exile will continue across subsequent expansions.","Expedition","",[],[],"","Art/2DArt/UIImages/Login/LeagueInfo/textbackground","",""
