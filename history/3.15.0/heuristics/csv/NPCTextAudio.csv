An evil older than time itself roamed these lands feeding on the memories of Valdo Caeserius, a son of Oriath. \r\n\r\nAlas, the fiend that fed upon him was powerful beyond measure, and unerring in its desire to spread what we discovered was known as the 'Decay.'

We'd surely have fallen to the evil were it not for Sirus' courageous leadership... and his sacrifice. \r\n\r\nWe could find no way to slay the demon, though we tried countless times. It was the daughter of Valdo who found a way to seal it, though it cost poor Zana her father, rest his soul. Our gambit would have failed were it not for Sirus. The demon would not give in, clawing its way from Zana's device. Sirus... He leapt onto it. We saw the demon tap into his body, at last relinquishing its grip. Sirus and the demon spiraled into the trap and out of our reality. Both gone. \r\n\r\nThen Sirus was there once more. None of us witnessed his return. His eyes did not move, he did not blink, and his mutterings... Mad and unceasing. Then his face contorted in ways I'd seen only from men possessed by the black spirit. He struck at us again and again. We could not restrain him. We had to flee that place. That is when we discovered our path home was sealed.

Time in the Atlas is a mirage. \r\n\r\nPlease, dear reader, if you have an ounce of sense in your body, do not dwell here. Return to Oriath, or wherever it is you are from.

6690,"TibbsAboutBoss","","Heard the Boss got his start as a stable boy in the Grand Arena. Used to feed and care for the chariot horses. That was his first job, and it led to his first ... err, 'job'. \r\n\r\nApparently, someone asked him to slip something into the feed of the Octavius family's finest stallion, greatly favoured to win the race. Paid him a week's worth of his normal wages. Boss figured it was some sort of poison. So he watched the man place a bet, and poisoned that horse as well. Neither died, but neither won, and the Boss, betting his wages on a horse he knew to be fit as a gladiator, took home a killing. \r\n\r\n'Course, that was also his last day of gainful employment at the arena.

By my next birthday I was invited to join a little circus of sorts as the strongman. That's where I met Tullina, by the way.\r\n\r\nOne day, someone left a baby girl, named Opal, for the troupe leader. She had bright red eyes, but the most pale skin and whitest hair I'd ever seen. She became a sort of daughter of the whole troupe. We took turns looking after her. \r\n\r\nBy the time she was about seven, I'd grown quite attached to her, and she to me.

Leaving a little trail as I go so I can find my way out. Little azurite fuse trail winding its way back to the storehouse. Cost me an arm and a leg, that powder. Anyway, I'm right under where I thought the High Templar's office was. Start piling the powder up right under his fat arse. Planning to blow him back to Innocence. \r\n\r\nWell, I start hearing a hissing noise. And I start seeing the blue light down the end of the tunnel turning an angry red. It's moving towards me quick. And I'm thinking, this is it. This is where it ends for me, but at least I'll blow that high pain in the arse skyward. Then it stops. No hissing. No light. Just a silhouette. Tall as a man ever was. Taller than Tibbs. Don't know how he even got through the storehouse hole. This man... this glorious man! \r\n\r\nPut it down! He shouts. It's not worth the trouble. Come. It's time to go! So I put the bag down, and I start walking over to him. Running even. This man saved my life. I swear to myself I'll follow this Eternal Ideal of a man, this statue, this perfect specimen, as far as he will have me. And as I get close, my eyes adjust. This beautiful man comes into focus. His hand is extended to meet me. I reach out mine. There's an electricity between us. And as my fingers lock into his, he slaps a manacle around my wrist.
